### Project Detail: To address the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, our app provides a comprehensive solution to enhance disaster preparedness and response. Recognizing the critical issues of limited access to reliable information, insufficient education on disaster response, and fragmented communication channels, we developed an app designed to bridge these gaps. Users can quickly check their location on Google Maps, ensuring they are aware of their surroundings during emergencies. Real-time notifications keep users informed about disaster updates and critical alerts. The app features an FAQ section with detailed information on various natural disasters, offering essential education to users. It also supports charitable actions by allowing users to donate to individuals or organizations in need. By entering their pincode, users receive real-time status updates via the Ambee API, offering localized information about their area. The app’s login and registration functionalities ensure secure access and personalized user experiences. This multifaceted approach ensures users have immediate access to critical information, educational resources, and communication tools, ultimately improving their preparedness and response capabilities in the face of natural disasters.
